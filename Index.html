    <h1>What is Psychology?</h1>
    <p>
        Psychologists and psychiatrists are medical professionals who are tasked with the duty to collaboratively guide and counsel individuals who can also be people suffering from anxiety, depression, panic attacks and other mental health related disorders.
        So what exactly do we mean by the term <i>Psychology?</i> Psychology is the study of how the mind works and how it evokes different kinds of behaviours. Psychology is a behaviour <i>blanket</i> that entails individuals' emotions, experiences as mainly dictated by activities and experiences that surround an individual and determine the way that individual will behave from an early age to being an adult.
        Individuals who have mental health challenges or disorders are said to have psychological related issues.
